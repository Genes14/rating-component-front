ENGLISH:
This is a Challenge from "Front End Mentor" (www.frontendmentor.io) site where it shows a rating page.
It has ratings from 1 to 5 and a button to submit the answer.
After submiting the answer the original container hides and show another one that shows the rate given.
Only the colours and a design's picture has been given to me.

The page is deployed in the netlify's host with the following dominion: (https://steady-truffle-1cbd82.netlify.app/).
